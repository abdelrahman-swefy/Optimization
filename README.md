# Optimization Methods for Multivariable Functions

This project provides an implementation of two optimization methods for multivariable functions: Gradient Descent and Newton-Raphson. The implementation is provided in Python, using the libraries NumPy, SymPy, Matplotlib.


To use the implementation, The notebook includes two main functions: gradient_descent and newton_raphson, which take as input a multivariable function and an initial point, and return the optimized point, the iterations taken to converge, and a list of the gradients calculated during the optimization process.
